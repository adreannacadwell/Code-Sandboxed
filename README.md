# Code-Sandboxed ðŸ§ª

**A digital sandbox where code comes to play.**  
This repo is home to a collection of micro-games and digital crafts that are just as fun to make as they are to play â€” built for amusement, exploration, and the occasional "aha!" moment in the browser.

### ðŸŽ¯ TicTacThink
A smart twist on the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, powered by the Minimax algorithm. Itâ€™s quick, clever, and impossible to beat (unless youâ€™re perfect).
